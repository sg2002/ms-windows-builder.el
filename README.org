* ms-windows-builder.el
This script automates the process of compiling GNU Emacs on the MS Windows platform.  Multiple toolchains(Msys2, MinGW, Cygwin) are supported.

** Requirements
1. Git.  It should be present on your PATH.
2. Wget.  You can [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm][get it from GnuWin project]].  Or [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/wget-1.16.1-w32-bin.zip/download][from ezwinports]].  Then either put it on PATH or set mwb-wget-paths.  The default path for the GnuWin version is already set up.
** Side effects
Anything downloaded by this script using wget gets stored inside mwb-wget-download-directory and reused if it's already there.

Bsdtar would get installed, unless it's already present on your PATH.  If it's not present unzip.exe would be downloaded and used to install it.

Any toolchain required would be installed and set up for building Emacs, unless already present.
** Usage
Put the script onto your load-path, then require it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ms-windows-builder)
#+end_src
Then call the build function:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mwb-build selected-toolchain output-directory configuration source)
#+end_src
Toolchain should be a symbol pointing to one of the toolchains defined in mwb-toolchains.

Output directory is the directory into which Emacs would get installed.

Configuration is optional and should be a symbol pointing to one of the configurations preset in mwb-configurations.  By default mwb-default-configuration(release) would be used.

Source should be pointing to a folder containing GNU Emacs sources.  Or you can set mwb-emacs-source instead.

Example usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Call only one of those at a time, not all!
  (mwb-build 'mingw "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-mingw" 'release "c:/Emacs/source/repo")
  (mwb-build 'msys2-x32 "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-msys2-x32"  'release "c:/Emacs/source/repo")
  (mwb-build 'msys2-x64 "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-msys2-x64" 'release "c:/Emacs/source/repo")
  (mwb-build 'cygwin-x32 "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-cygwin-x32" 'release "c:/Emacs/source/repo")
  (mwb-build 'cygwin-x64 "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-cygwin-x64" 'release "c:/Emacs/source/repo")
  ;; Configuration and source are actually optional.
  (mwb-build 'msys2-x64 "c:/Emacs/bin/main-release-msys2-x64")
#+end_src

This script outputs everything into the "mwb" buffer.  You can stop the build process at any time by calling mwb-stop.

Depending on your hardware and whether you are installing the toolchain, the whole process is estimated to take between 10 and 30 minutes.
*** Notifications on operation completion
You can use mwb-finish-notification-functions hook to pass build completion notifications.  For example, you can use [[https://github.com/vaskovsky/notify-send][notify-send for Windows]] to send messages into Windows 10 notification center:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun mwb-notify-send (message)
    (call-process-shell-command (format "notify-send MWB \"%s\"" message)))
  (add-hook 'mwb-finish-notification-functions 'mwb-notify-send)
#+end_src
*** Msys2 specific
During msys2 setup you would get a shell window.  You can close it after it's done with the setup and you see the command prompt.
*** Launching Cygwin Emacs without a terminal window akin to runemacs.exe in other toolchains
Cygwin provides a run.exe utility you can use to start Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC eshell
c:\Emacs\cygwin64\bin\run.exe emacs-27.1.exe
#+end_src
** Emacs optional feature checklist
To ensure that everything possible is working in your Emacs build, you should check for the presence of the following features.
*** harfbuzz
Calling (frame-parameter nil 'font-backend) should return harfbuzz first.  Emacs is using harfbuzz since 27.1.
*** gnutls
Calling (gnutls-available-p) should return a non nil value.
*** json
Calling (json-serialize '((test . 1))) should return a non nil value.  Json library support was added in 27.1.
*** gmp
GMP should be one of the values in system-configuraiton-features.  GMP is supported since 27.1.
*** gif, jpeg, png, tiff, xpm and svg
Make sure to try and open all 6 supported image formats.
** Known issues
*** MinGW
Harfbuzz and GMP currently does not work for MinGW.

If you have MinGW already installed and try to use the same location, but it does not have all of the required components, the build would break.  You can manually install components into an existing directory using (mwb-mingw-install-packages).  This script assumes that your Msys is installed within the MinGW tree.  Otherwise, installing a different MinGW using this script is highly recommended.
*** Cygwin
Cygwin builds are done --with-w32, harfbuzz does not work and there is no svg image support.

The build would break if you have Cygwin already installed and try to use the same location, but it does not have all of the required components.  You can manually install packages into an existing Cygwin installation by evaluating (mwb-cygwin-install 'x32) for x32 and (mwb-cygwin-install 'x64) for x64.
** Troubleshooting
Make sure that mwb-wget-download-directory, mwb-configurations-directory, the toolchain directory you want to use(mwb-mingw-directory, mwb-msys2-64-directory, mwb-msys2-32-directory) and the root of your output-directory are all writable. For the output directory we want the root, since we're actually compiling into a temporary directory first and then renaming it.

If the script is unable to download one of the dependenices, open its path in browser and see if there's a newer version. Then replace it in the config file.

If some optional feature does not work, try opening the library dll with the [[https://www.dependencywalker.com/][Dependency Walker]] to see if it has some new dependency you're missing and try copying that dependency into your emacs/bin folder.  It's probably librsvg and it just won't stop until it starts depending on every single library ever written.

For Msys2 it should install all of the required packages, you can also force the package installation manually using (mwb-msys2-install-packages).
** Compatibility
This script was tested for each toolchain building the following Emacs versions.  The latest versions are installed for most of the toolchain components, so you can expect this info to be wrong due to possible future versions breaking the builds.  Only the MinGW toolchain is strictly tied to the particular component versions, so the compatibility for it should not change.
